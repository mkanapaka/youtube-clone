# Youtube Home Page clone

This is a static webpage built with HTML and CSS that clones Youtube Homepage from youtube.com

I have recreated the Youtube homepage extensively with a header, side-nav bar and a video grid. All of these were styled extensively with flex-box and grid properties of css. All of these can be easily tweaked when you fork this and you can play around with the styling using the css sheet 

# Usage

All the thumbnails, icons used in the webpage are taken from respective owners and only used for the purpose of practice. 

# License

There is no licensing needed to use this. Feel free to give credit when you fork it.
